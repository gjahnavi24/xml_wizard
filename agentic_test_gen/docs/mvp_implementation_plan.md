## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each MVP:

1. **Start Small**: Focus only on the specific MVP goals
2. **Write Tests First**: Create unit tests for each component
3. **Document Progress**: Update progress docs after each MVP
4. **Demo Early**: Create a working demo after each MVP
5. **Refactor Minimally**: Only refactor when necessary for next MVP

### File Structure Per MVP:
```
agentic_test_gen/
├── core/                 # Core analysis components
│   ├── xslt_analyzer.py
│   ├── helper_template_extractor.py
│   ├── test_case_generator.py
│   └── pytest_code_generator.py
├── tests/                # Unit tests for each component
├── examples/             # Example outputs and demos
├── docs/                 # Documentation and progress tracking
└── streamlit_ui/         # Streamlit integration components
```

### Success Metrics Per MVP:
- **Functionality**: Core feature works as specified
- **Testing**: All unit tests pass
- **Documentation**: Clear README and examples
- **Demo**: Working demonstration available
- **Integration**: Builds properly on previous MVP

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Time Boxing**: Strict 1-3 day limits per MVP
- **Scope Creep**: Only implement MVP requirements
- **Dependencies**: Each MVP should be independently testable
- **Rollback**: Easy to rollback to previous MVP if needed

This plan ensures tight control while making steady, demonstrable progress toward the complete system.
