# Multi-Pass Analysis Design Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive design documentation for implementing multi-pass cross-chunk analysis in the Enhanced XSLT POC. The multi-pass approach aims to achieve human-like reliability by understanding complete business workflows that span multiple chunks, rather than just individual patterns within chunks.

**Current Status**: Phase 4.6+4.7 COMPLETE - 159% coverage with implementation-grade specifications  
**Next Phase**: Multi-pass cross-chunk analysis for complete workflow understanding  
**Goal**: Achieve human-level transformation analysis reliability through workflow-level understanding

---

## 1. Problem Statement and Motivation

### 1.1 Current Achievement vs Human Analysis Gap

**Current POC Achievement (Single-Chunk Analysis)**:
- ✅ **159% coverage** (81 mappings vs 51 manual functional components)
- ✅ **Character-level accuracy** in XSLT formula extraction
- ✅ **Perfect template function binding** within chunks (vmf1-vmf4)
- ✅ **Implementation-grade specifications** for individual patterns

**Gap: Missing Cross-Chunk Business Process Understanding**:
- ❌ **Template usage workflows** that span multiple chunks
- ❌ **Variable dependency chains** across chunk boundaries
- ❌ **Complete business process sequences** (e.g., SSR generation workflows)
- ❌ **System-specific conditional logic** spanning multiple processing areas
- ❌ **End-to-end transformation flows** from input to business output

### 1.2 Why Multi-Pass Analysis is Critical

**Human analysts naturally see**:
1. **Workflow sequences**: How individual patterns combine into complete business processes
2. **Cross-chunk relationships**: Template calls, variable dependencies, conditional logic spanning chunks
3. **System-specific variations**: How target systems affect processing across multiple areas
4. **Business process completeness**: End-to-end understanding of transformation goals

**Without multi-pass analysis**, our specifications are:
- **Technically complete** but **functionally incomplete**
- **Pattern-rich** but **process-poor**
- **Implementation-ready** for individual mappings but **incomplete for workflow understanding**

### 3.2 Relationship Matrix Construction

```python
def build_relationship_matrix(chunk_metadata):
    """Create relationship mappings between chunks"""
    
    relationships = {
        'template_flows': {},     # template_def_chunk → call_site_chunks

### 3.3 Template Call Graph Algorithm

```python
def build_template_call_graph(chunks):
    """Build directed graph of template calls across chunks"""
    
    import networkx as nx
    graph = nx.DiGraph()
    
    # Add nodes (templates)
    for chunk in chunks:
        for template in chunk.templates_defined:
            graph.add_node(template, 
                          chunk_id=chunk.id, 
                          type='definition',
                          business_purpose=extract_template_purpose(template, chunk))
    
    # Add edges (calls)
    for chunk in chunks:
        for template_call in chunk.template_calls:

                    )
    
    return graph

### 3.4 Variable Dependency Chain Algorithm

def build_variable_dependency_chains(chunks):
    """Track variable definitions and usage across chunks"""
    
    dependency_chains = {}
    
    for chunk in chunks:
        for var_def in chunk.variables_defined:

## 4. Universal Pattern Discovery (Domain-Agnostic Approach)

### 4.1 The Overfitting Problem

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Initial approach was severely overfitted to airline/IATA domain:

```python
# WRONG - Domain-specific overfitting
for ssr_type in ['GSTN', 'GSTA', 'GSTP', 'FOID']:  # Only works for airlines
for target_system in ['UA', 'UAD', 'OTHER']:        # Only works for airlines
identify_ssr_generation_patterns()                  # Only works for airlines
```

**This approach would completely fail on**:
- Healthcare FHIR transformations
- Financial data processing XSLTs
- Manufacturing workflow transformations
- E-commerce order processing
- Any non-airline domain

## 9. Beginner's Guide: Understanding Multi-Pass Analysis

*This section explains the multi-pass analysis approach in simple terms for new team members.*

### 9.1 What We're Trying to Solve (The Simple Version)

**Imagine you're trying to understand a recipe** for a complex dish by reading it one paragraph at a time, but each paragraph is on a different page. You might understand each individual step (like "chop onions" or "heat oil"), but you'd miss how all the steps work together to create the final dish.

**That's exactly our problem with XSLT transformations!**

Our current POC is incredibly good at understanding individual "recipe steps" (mapping specifications) within small chunks of XSLT code. We achieved 159% coverage, which means we found more patterns than even human experts documented. But we're missing the "complete recipe" - how all these steps work together across different chunks to accomplish business goals.

### 9.2 Real-World Example: Why Cross-Chunk Analysis Matters

**Let's use a concrete example from our airline XSLT:**

#### What Our Current POC Sees (Single-Chunk Analysis):
```
Chunk A: "I see a template that converts P → VPT (passport type conversion)"
Chunk B: "I see some substring operations extracting characters" 
Chunk C: "I see document creation code"
Chunk D: "I see passenger record validation"
```

#### What We're Missing (The Complete Business Process):
```
Complete Workflow: 
1. vmf1 template converts document type (P/PT → VPT) 
2. Result goes to substring operation to extract first 3 characters
3. Extracted value feeds into identity document creation
4. Created document gets validated for passenger record
5. Final result: Complete passenger identity verification process
```

**The Problem**: Our current POC sees 4 separate mappings, but misses that they're actually 1 complete business workflow for passenger identity verification.

### 9.3 The Multi-Pass Strategy (Step-by-Step)

Think of multi-pass analysis like being a detective solving a complex case:

#### **Pass 1: Gather All the Evidence (COMPLETED)**
- **What it does**: Analyze each chunk individually and extract all patterns
- **Like a detective**: Collecting fingerprints, witness statements, physical evidence from each crime scene
- **Our achievement**: 159% coverage - we found more evidence than anyone expected!
- **Result**: 81 individual mapping specifications with implementation-grade precision

#### **Pass 2: Find the Connections (NEW)**
- **What it does**: Look for relationships between chunks - template calls, variable usage, data flow
- **Like a detective**: "Wait, this fingerprint from scene A matches a person mentioned in the witness statement from scene B!"
- **Technical details**: Build relationship matrices, template call graphs, variable dependency chains
- **Result**: Complete map of how chunks relate to each other

#### **Pass 3: Reconstruct the Complete Story (NEW)**
- **What it does**: Use the connections to understand complete business workflows
- **Like a detective**: "Now I see the complete sequence - the suspect was at location A, then B, then C, which explains the entire crime"
- **Technical details**: Workflow sequence discovery, business process documentation
- **Result**: End-to-end understanding of business transformations

#### **Pass 4: Write the Final Report (NEW)**
- **What it does**: Combine individual patterns + workflows into complete implementation specifications
- **Like a detective**: Writing the final case report that explains both individual evidence AND the complete story
- **Technical details**: Implementation-ready specifications with workflow context
- **Result**: Human-level transformation understanding

### 9.4 Why This Is Hard (And Why It's Worth It)

#### **The Technical Challenge**
Imagine you have a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, but instead of seeing the box cover, you have to figure out what the final picture looks like by examining each piece individually, then figuring out how they connect.

**That's what we're doing with XSLT transformations:**
- Each chunk is like a puzzle piece
- Individual pieces make sense on their own (our current 159% success)
- But the real value is understanding the complete picture (what we're adding)

#### **The Business Value**
**Current State**: "We can tell you there are 81 individual transformation patterns in this XSLT"
**Multi-Pass Goal**: "We can tell you there are 6 complete business processes: passenger identity verification, special service request generation, document validation, target system routing, tax identifier processing, and contact information standardization - and here's exactly how each one works from start to finish"

### 9.5 The Universal Challenge (Why We Almost Failed)

#### **The Trap We Almost Fell Into**
When I first designed this, I made a classic beginner mistake - **overfitting to our specific example**.

**Bad Approach (Domain-Specific)**:
```python
# This would ONLY work for airline transformations
find_ssr_patterns(['GSTN', 'GSTA', 'GSTP', 'FOID'])  # Airline-specific codes
find_target_systems(['UA', 'UAD', 'OTHER'])          # Airline-specific systems
```

**Problem**: This would completely fail if tomorrow you wanted to analyze:
- A healthcare FHIR transformation XSLT
- A financial data processing XSLT  
- A manufacturing workflow XSLT
- Any non-airline business domain

#### **The Universal Solution (Domain-Agnostic)**
Instead of looking for airline-specific patterns, we look for **universal XSLT language patterns**:

```python
# This works for ANY business domain
find_template_usage_chains()      # Templates exist in all XSLT
find_variable_dependency_flows()  # Variables exist in all XSLT
find_conditional_logic_trees()    # Conditions exist in all XSLT
find_data_aggregation_patterns()  # Aggregation exists in all XSLT
```

**Then we let the AI figure out**: "Based on these universal patterns, this looks like a healthcare patient record transformation" or "this looks like financial transaction processing"

### 9.6 How We Prevent Overfitting (The Smart Approach)

#### **Think Like a Language Teacher, Not a Domain Expert**
- **Domain Expert Approach**: "I know this is airline data, so I'll look for airline-specific patterns"
- **Language Teacher Approach**: "I see XSLT language constructs - templates, variables, conditions. Let me understand what business purpose they serve"

#### **The Universal Pattern Categories**
We identified 6 universal transformation archetypes that exist in **ANY** XSLT:

1. **DATA_ENRICHMENT**: Take input, add more information, produce enriched output
2. **DATA_AGGREGATION**: Take multiple inputs, combine them, produce single output  
3. **DATA_VALIDATION**: Take input, check rules, produce validated output or error
4. **DATA_TRANSFORMATION**: Take source format, apply mapping rules, produce target format
5. **WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATION**: Trigger → sequence of operations → final result
6. **DATA_FILTERING**: Take dataset, apply criteria, produce filtered subset

**These patterns exist whether you're processing**:
- Airline reservations (our current example)
- Hospital patient records  
- Bank transactions
- Manufacturing orders
- E-commerce purchases

### 9.7 What Success Looks Like (Concrete Examples)

#### **Current POC Success (Pass 1)**
```
Input: OrderCreate_MapForce_Full.xslt (1,869 lines)
Output: 81 individual mapping specifications
Example: "vmf1 template converts P/PT → VPT with exact formula translate(documentType, 'P', 'VPT')"
```

#### **Multi-Pass Success (Passes 1-4)**
```
Input: OrderCreate_MapForce_Full.xslt (1,869 lines)  
Output: 81 individual mappings + 6 complete business workflows
Example: "Passenger Identity Verification Workflow:
  Step 1: vmf1 template standardizes document type (P/PT → VPT) 
  Step 2: substring(result, 1, 3) extracts document code
  Step 3: Document creation with extracted code
  Step 4: Passenger record validation 
  Step 5: Final identity verification result
  Business Purpose: Ensure passenger identity documents meet airline standards
  Triggers: When passenger has identity document data
  Dependencies: vmf1 template + document validation rules
  Output: Verified passenger identity record"
```

### 9.8 Why We're Confident This Will Work

#### **We Have Strong Foundations**
1. **Proven Single-Chunk Success**: 159% coverage shows our approach works
2. **Clear Technical Path**: Cross-chunk relationships are algorithmic (high confidence)
3. **Universal Design**: Domain-agnostic approach prevents overfitting
4. **Incremental Validation**: We can validate each pass against manual analysis

#### **Realistic Risk Assessment**
- **High Confidence**: Finding relationships between chunks (this is mostly algorithmic)
- **Medium Confidence**: Understanding workflow sequences (AI-guided with validation)
- **Lower Confidence**: Perfect business process inference (depends on AI understanding)

**Even if we only achieve the high/medium confidence parts, we'll have major improvement in transformation understanding.**
