# Proof of Concept Validation Specification

## Overview

Before implementing the full 6-agent system, we must validate that our LLM-based approach can match the quality of manual analysis that generated 132+ meaningful test cases from OrderCreate_MapForce_Full.xslt. This PoC prevents building a system that generates many syntactically correct but business-meaningless test cases.

## PoC Objectives

### **Primary Objective**
Prove that AI agents can achieve **90%+ quality match** with manual analysis baseline on business understanding dimensions.

### **Secondary Objectives**
- Identify optimal LLM prompting strategies for business context extraction
- Validate domain knowledge integration approaches
- Establish quality measurement frameworks
- Test cross-chunk dependency understanding

## PoC Success Criteria

### **Quantitative Criteria**
- **Overall Quality Score**: ≥90% match with manual baseline
- **Business Understanding**: ≥85% average score
- **Test Meaningfulness**: ≥90% average score  
- **Integration Awareness**: ≥80% average score on complex cases
- **Coverage Completeness**: Identify ≥90% of manual analysis business rules

### **Qualitative Criteria**
- AI demonstrates understanding of **WHY** business rules exist (not just WHAT they do)
- Generated tests would catch **real business bugs** (not just syntax errors)
- AI recognizes **cross-chunk dependencies** and integration patterns
- AI shows **domain awareness** of IATA NDC context and requirements

## Manual Analysis Baseline Extraction

        self.business_context = ""          # WHY this rule exists
        self.business_scenario = ""         # WHAT business situation it handles
        self.xslt_chunk = ""               # Relevant XSLT code

        self.failure_impact = ""            # What breaks if rule fails
        self.cross_chunk_dependencies = []  # Related chunks/rules
        self.domain_context = ""            # IATA NDC specific context
        self.test_scenarios = []            # Multiple test variations

    """Score how well AI understands business context"""
    scores = []

    context_match = semantic_similarity(manual_context, ai_context)
    scores.append(context_match * 0.4)
    
    # Domain awareness: Does AI show IATA NDC understanding?
    domain_score = check_domain_knowledge(ai_context, "IATA_NDC")
    scores.append(domain_score * 0.3)
    
    # Purpose understanding: Does AI grasp rule purpose?
    purpose_score = compare_purpose_understanding(manual_context, ai_context)
    scores.append(purpose_score * 0.3)
    
    return sum(scores)
```

#### **Scenario Coverage Score (25%)**
```python
def score_scenario_coverage(manual_scenarios, ai_scenarios):

    depth_score = evaluate_scenario_depth(ai_scenarios)
    
    # Business relevance: Are scenarios business-meaningful?
    relevance_score = evaluate_business_relevance(ai_scenarios)
    
    return (overlap_score * 0.5 + depth_score * 0.3 + relevance_score * 0.2)
```

#### **Test Meaningfulness Score (25%)**
```python
def score_test_meaningfulness(manual_tests, ai_tests):
    """Score whether AI generates business-meaningful tests"""
    # Bug detection potential: Would tests catch real bugs?
    bug_detection_score = evaluate_bug_detection_potential(ai_tests)
    
    # Business scenario coverage: Do tests cover business scenarios?
    scenario_coverage = evaluate_test_scenario_coverage(ai_tests)
    
    # Test quality: Are tests well-structured and executable?
    test_quality = evaluate_test_structure_quality(ai_tests)
    
    return (bug_detection_score * 0.5 + scenario_coverage * 0.3 + test_quality * 0.2)
```

#### **Integration Awareness Score (20%)**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.iata_ndc_context = {
            'purpose': 'IATA New Distribution Capability for airline retailing',
            'compliance_requirements': [
                'Standardized data formats',

## Validation Process

### **Day-by-Day PoC Execution**

#### **Day 1: Baseline Preparation**
1. Extract 15 baseline test cases from manual analysis
2. Structure cases with full business context
3. Set up quality measurement framework
4. Prepare domain knowledge base

#### **Day 2: Framework Implementation** 
1. Implement quality scoring algorithms
2. Create domain knowledge integration
3. Develop enhanced prompting strategies
4. Set up validation infrastructure

#### **Day 3: Minimal Agent Development**
1. Build minimal XSLT analyzer with business focus
2. Implement LLM integration with domain knowledge
3. Create business-focused response parsing
4. Test on 2-3 simple baseline cases

#### **Day 4: Iterative Refinement**
1. Run agent on all 15 baseline cases
2. Score quality matches for each case
3. Identify improvement areas
4. Refine prompts and approach
5. Re-test with improvements

#### **Day 5: Final Validation & Decision**
1. Comprehensive validation run
2. Calculate overall quality scores
3. Analyze dimension-specific performance  
4. Generate recommendation (Proceed/Refine/Rethink)
5. Document lessons learned for Phase 2B

### **Decision Matrix**

#### **Proceed to Micro-MVPs (90%+ quality match)**
```python
if overall_score >= 0.9 and business_understanding >= 0.85:
    decision = "PROCEED_TO_MICRO_MVPS"
    next_steps = [
        "Begin Phase 2B with validated approach",
        "Scale proven methods to full system",
        "Apply PoC learnings to agent design",
        "Maintain quality gates throughout development"
    ]
```

#### **Refine Approach (70-89% quality match)**
```python
if 0.7 <= overall_score < 0.9:
    decision = "REFINE_APPROACH"
    next_steps = [
        "Identify specific improvement areas",
        "Enhance domain knowledge integration",
        "Improve business context prompting",
        "Re-run PoC with refinements"
    ]
```

#### **Rethink Approach (<70% quality match)**
```python
if overall_score < 0.7:
    decision = "RETHINK_APPROACH"
    alternatives = [
        "Hybrid human-AI workflow",
        "Deeper domain knowledge integration",
        "Alternative LLM models or approaches",
        "Manual analysis with AI assistance"
    ]
```

## Risk Mitigation

### **PoC-Specific Risks**

#### **Risk 1: Insufficient Manual Baseline**
**Mitigation**: Spend extra time on baseline extraction, ensure business context is captured

#### **Risk 2: LLM Inconsistency** 
**Mitigation**: Run multiple iterations, use temperature controls, validate consistency

#### **Risk 3: Quality Measurement Subjectivity**
**Mitigation**: Multiple evaluators, objective criteria where possible, manual review

#### **Risk 4: Domain Knowledge Gaps**
**Mitigation**: Research IATA NDC thoroughly, consult domain experts if available

## Success Probability

### **High Confidence Indicators**
- Business understanding scores >85% consistently
- AI demonstrates domain awareness unprompted
- Generated tests focus on business scenarios
- Cross-chunk dependencies correctly identified

### **Medium Confidence Indicators**  
- Technical analysis is strong but business context weak
- Some business understanding but inconsistent
- Tests are syntactically correct but business relevance unclear

### **Low Confidence Indicators**
- Cannot demonstrate business context understanding
- Generated tests focus only on syntax
- No integration awareness shown
- Domain knowledge not internalized

This PoC specification ensures we validate our approach thoroughly before committing to full development, significantly increasing our chances of building a system that achieves the actual goal of matching manual analysis quality.
